The Full-Lifecycle Guide to API Design

Principles of Web API Design brings together principles and processes to help you succeed across the entire API 
design lifecycle. Drawing on extensive in-the-trenches experience, leading consultant James Higginbotham 
helps you align every stakeholder on specific outcomes, design APIs that deliver value, and 
scale the design process from small teams to the entire organization.

Higginbotham helps you bring an “outside-in” perspective to API design to reflect the 
voices of customers and product teams, map requirements to specific and well-organized APIs, 
and choose the right API style for writing them. He walks through a real-world example from 
the ground up, offering guidance for anyone designing new APIs or extending existing APIs.

Deliver great APIs by getting your design processes right
Gain agreement on specific outcomes from design teams, customers, and other stakeholders
Craft job stories, conduct EventStorming, and model capabilities
Identify the right APIs, and organize operations into coherent API profiles
Choose the best styles for each project: REST, gRPC, GraphQL, or event-based async APIs
Refine designs based on feedback from documenters, testers, and customers
Decompose APIs into microservices
Mature your API program, implementing design and management processes that scale
This guide is invaluable for anyone involved in planning or building APIs–architects, developers, 
team leaders, managers in single and multi-team environments, and any technical or business 
professional delivering “API-as-a-product” offerings.
