# REST is a software Architectural Style that basically exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web.

# RESTful is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture.

# REST
  Representational state transfer is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the WWW.
  As such, it is not strictly only a method of building what are sometimes called "web services."The terms "representational state transfer" and "REST" were introduced in 2000 in Roy Fielding's doctoral dissertation also one of the principal authors of HTTP specification.

  REST strictly refers to a collection of network architecture principles which outline how resources are defined and addressed. The term is often used in a looser sense to describe any simple interface which transmits domain-specific data over HTTP without an additional messaging layer such as SOAP or session tracking via cookies. These two meanings can conflict as well as overlap. It is possible to design any large software system in accordance with Fileding's REST architectural style without using HTTP and without interacting with the world wide web. It is also possible to design simple XML + HTTP interfaces which do no conform to REST principles, and instead follow a model of remote procedure calls. The difference between the uses of the term **"REST"** therefore causes **some confusion in technical discussions.**

# Systems which follow Fielding's REST principles are often referred to as "RESTful"

   Most introductions to REST start with the formal definition and background. The simplified pragmatic definition is a set of principles that define how Web standards, such as HTTP and URI's are supposed to be used ( which often differers quite a bit from what many people actually do). The promise is that if you adhere to REST principles while designing your application, you will end up with a system that exploits the Web's architecture to your benefit. In summary, the five key principles are:

# 1. Give everything an ID
# 2. Link things together
# 3. Use standard methods
# 4. Resources with multiple representations
# 5. Communicate in a stateless manner

# RESTful:

   In REST, the software application architecture modeled after the way data is represented, accessed and modified on the web is an architecture in which data and functionality are considered resources, and these resources are accessed using URI's Uniform Resource Identifier, typically links on the web. The REST architecture **is fundamentally a client-server architecture:**, and is designed to use a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP. In REST, clients and servers exchange representations of resources using a standardized interface and protocol. These principles encourage REST applications to be simple, lightweight, and have high performance.

# RESTful web services are web applications built upon the REST architecture.
   They:
   expose resource ( data and functionality ) through the web URIs
   use the four main HTTP methods - ** CRUD ** create, read, update and delete resources.
   RESTful web services typically map the four main HTTP methods to CRUD.

# GET : retrieve a resource
# POST: Create a resource
# PUT:  Update a resource
# DELETE: delete a resource
